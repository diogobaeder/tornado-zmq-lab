# Laboratory for experiments with Tornado and pyzmq (0MQ binding in Python)

First I started this little project to test some usages with Tornado and 0MQ (see the random-replies subdir), but I became more interested in making more different tests with these tools, as they make non-blocking I/O and asynchronous communication very easy, without the need for explicit multi-threading.

I hope I can fill up with more interesting cases while studying these tools.
